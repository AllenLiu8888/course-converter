This template is similar to the Text template. The only difference is that this template opens in the Raw HTML editor rather than in the Visual editor.

The Raw HTML editor saves your HTML exactly as you enter it. You can switch to the Visual editor by clicking the Settings tab and changing the Editor setting to Visual. Note, however, that some of your HTML may be modified when you save the component if you switch to the Visual editor.
